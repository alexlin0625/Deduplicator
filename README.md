# Deduplicator

# I. Documentation

### Project Description 
Design and implement an efficient data storage locker that utilizes deduplication. The locker should be able to accept files and store them with a minimum storage by storing some common data blocks only once. The file should also be retrieved from the locker and all content remain the same without any corruption.
